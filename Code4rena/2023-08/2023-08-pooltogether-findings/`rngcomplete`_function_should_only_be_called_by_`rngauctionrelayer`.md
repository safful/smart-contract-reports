# [`rngComplete` function should only be called by `rngAuctionRelayer`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-pooltogether-findings/issues/82)

# Vulnerability details

## Impact

The `rngComplete` function is supposed to be called by the relayer to complete the Rng relay auction and send auction rewards to the recipient, but because the function doesn't have any access control it can be called by anyone, an attacker can call the function before the relayer and give a different `_rewardRecipient` and thus he can collect all the rewards and the true auction reward recipient will not get any.

## Proof of Concept

The issue occurs in the `rngComplete` function below :

```solidity
function rngComplete(
    uint256 _randomNumber,
    uint256 _rngCompletedAt,
    address _rewardRecipient, // @audit can set any address
    uint32 _sequenceId,
    AuctionResult calldata _rngAuctionResult
) external returns (bytes32) {
    // @audit should only be callable by rngAuctionRelayer
    if (_sequenceHasCompleted(_sequenceId)) revert SequenceAlreadyCompleted();
    uint64 _auctionElapsedSeconds = uint64(
        block.timestamp < _rngCompletedAt ? 0 : block.timestamp - _rngCompletedAt
    );
    if (_auctionElapsedSeconds > (_auctionDurationSeconds - 1)) revert AuctionExpired();
    // Calculate the reward fraction and set the draw auction results
    UD2x18 rewardFraction = _fractionalReward(_auctionElapsedSeconds);
    _auctionResults.rewardFraction = rewardFraction;
    _auctionResults.recipient = _rewardRecipient;
    _lastSequenceId = _sequenceId;

    AuctionResult[] memory auctionResults = new AuctionResult[](2);
    auctionResults[0] = _rngAuctionResult;
    auctionResults[1] = AuctionResult({
        rewardFraction: rewardFraction,
        recipient: _rewardRecipient
    });

    uint32 drawId = prizePool.closeDraw(_randomNumber);

    uint256 futureReserve = prizePool.reserve() + prizePool.reserveForOpenDraw();
    uint256[] memory _rewards = RewardLib.rewards(auctionResults, futureReserve);

    emit RngSequenceCompleted(
        _sequenceId,
        drawId,
        _rewardRecipient,
        _auctionElapsedSeconds,
        rewardFraction
    );

    for (uint8 i = 0; i < _rewards.length; i++) {
        uint104 _reward = uint104(_rewards[i]); 
        if (_reward > 0) {
            prizePool.withdrawReserve(auctionResults[i].recipient, _reward);
            emit AuctionRewardDistributed(_sequenceId, auctionResults[i].recipient, i, _reward);
        }
    }

    return bytes32(uint(drawId));
}
```

As we can see the function does not have any access control (modifier or check on the msg.sender), so any user can call it and you can also notice that the `_rewardRecipient` (the address that receives the rewards) is given as argument to the function and there is no check to verify that it is the correct auction reward receiver. 

Hence an attacker can call the function before the relayer does, he can thus complete the auction and give another address for `_rewardRecipient` which will receive all the rewards.

The result is in the end that the true auction reward recipient will get his reward stolen by other users.

## Tools Used

Manual review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a check in the `rngComplete` function to make sure that only the relayer can call it, the function can be modified as follows :

```solidity
function rngComplete(
    uint256 _randomNumber,
    uint256 _rngCompletedAt,
    address _rewardRecipient, 
    uint32 _sequenceId,
    AuctionResult calldata _rngAuctionResult
) external returns (bytes32) {
    // @audit only called by rngAuctionRelayer
    if (msg.sender != rngAuctionRelayer) revert NotRelayer();
    ...
}
```
